Generates a library for your video information where you can upload caption files, include transcripts, and upload subtitles for other languages.

== Description ==

Accessible Video Library solves a problem in WordPress: the ability to manage videos and manage critical associated media including captions, transcripts, and subtitles for each video.

In WordPress 3.6, WordPress incorporated the MediaElements.js library for showing videos. It's a good library, and includes native support for captions and internationalization, is keyboard accessible, and supports YouTube.

However, the WordPress implementation doesn't provide any method to add captions, subtitles, or reference YouTube videos. You can always embed YouTube videos using oEmbed, but these videos don't have much at all in the way of keyboard support. 

Accessible Video Library gives you a custom post type that you can use to manage your video media. You can upload captions in .SRT or .DFXP format, upload subtitles also in .SRT or .DFXP format, use the content of the post to include a video transcript, and can reference YouTube videos. 

Additionally, you can upload multiple formats of your video files to improve browser compatibility for your videos.
